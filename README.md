1. I would fit my automated tests for my Recipe app within a GitHub action that runs whenever code is pushed so that we can get immediate feedback on what we just created.

2. If we run our field headless we couold xpected to see an error.

3. I would personally use a unit test to check the sending and receiving property of a messaging app since it is the main functionality.

4. I do not think I would set up a unit test for checking the max length because it is not one of the main features and could be treated as more of an edge case.
